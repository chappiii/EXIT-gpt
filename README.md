# Ethiopian Exit Exam Prep with ChatGPT - MERN Stack

## Project Overview
This project is designed to help students in Ethiopia prepare for the national exit exam by leveraging the power of OpenAI's GPT-3. The application provides three key features:

1. **Chatbot**: A real-time chat interface where students can interact with ChatGPT for answering questions and explanations.
2. **Model Examination**: A simulation of the Ethiopian exit exam UI and experience, providing practice tests.
3. **PDF to Exam Questions**: Upload a PDF document, and the system generates exam-style questions using GPT-3.

The project uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and integrates with OpenAI's ChatGPT API for its core functionality.
