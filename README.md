# Ethiopian Exit Exam Preparation Platform

This project is designed to help students prepare for the Ethiopian Exit Exam using cutting-edge AI technology. Leveraging the power of ChatGPT-3, the platform offers three main features:

- **Chat Bot:** Engage in interactive conversations with ChatGPT-3 to clarify doubts and gain insights.
- **Model Examination:** Experience a simulated exam interface that mirrors the Ethiopian Exit Exam, giving users a real exam environment.
- **PDF to Exam Questions:** Upload your study materials in PDF format and let the AI generate relevant exam questions using GPT-3.

The project follows a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack structure and is divided into two main directories: **frontend** and **backend**.
